# Suricata Rules
These rules are made for suricata and will be updated hopefully on a regular basis. The rules will be created from AlienVault OTX-pulses.

There are three Categories of rules:
* Social Media
* IP reputation
* Malicious file hashes

# Get Started
Copy the rules to the appropriate places, enable iprep and filestore in suricata and you should be good to go!
